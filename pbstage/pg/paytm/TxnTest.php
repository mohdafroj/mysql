 * That is why there are two ways to create the module: `RouterModule.forRoot` and
 * `RouterModule.forChild`.
 *
 * * `forRoot` creates a module that contains all the directives, the given routes, and the router
 *   service itself.
 * * `forChild` creates a module that contains all the directives and the given routes, but does not
 *   include the router service.
 *
 * When registered at the root, the module should be used as follows
 *
 * ```
 * \@NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * For submodules and lazy loaded submodules the module should be used as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * \@NgModule({
 *   imports: [RouterModule.forChild(ROUTES)]
 * })
 * class MyNgModule {}
 * ```

 * Adds router directives and providers.

 * Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is
 * especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL.
 * In addition, we often want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand.
 * Doing this transparently is not trivial.
 *
 * The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify
 * application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on
 * demand.
